A partial permutation is an ordering of only k objects taken from a collection containing n objects (i.e., k≤n). For example, one partial permutation of three of the first eight positive integers is given by (5,7,2)

The statistic P(n,k)
counts the total number of partial permutations of k objects that can be formed from a collection of n objects.

Given: Positive integers n
and k such that 100≥n>0 and 10≥k>0
Return: The total number of partial permutations P(n,k), modulo 1,000,000.
