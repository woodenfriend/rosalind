A DNA string is a reverse palindrome if it is equal to its reverse complement. For instance, GCATGC is a reverse palindrome because its reverse complement is GCATGC. See Figure 2.

Given: A DNA string of length at most 1 kbp in FASTA format.

Return: The position and length of every reverse palindrome in the string having length between 4 and 12. You may return these pairs in any order.
